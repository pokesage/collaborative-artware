# Collaborative Artware

This is an experimental online drawing application by Media Art and Design students at the University of Chicago. This is the main code repository for our collaborative project. See to the [Wiki tab](https://github.com/net-art-uchicago/collaborative-artware/wiki) for the class Syllabus and other notes.


# Setup

You'll need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) in order to run the server locally. After you have node installed, open a terminal and `cd` into the project directory and install all the dependencies by running: `npm install`.

Assuming you've installed the dependencies, simply run `node server` to launch the server and then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
